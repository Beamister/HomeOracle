<h1>Third Year Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The aim of this project is to develop a tool so that a user can predict how a property price is affected by changes in its surroundings. The underlying models should assume that the house in question remains unchanged.

For example, given a house costing Â£200,000 with the nearest school 1 mile away, then if a new school is built half a mile away then the model should predict the new price of the house.

This is being treated as a supervised learning regression problem.

Once the core functionality of the tool has been developed then the project will be extended so that a user can see which factors are the most limiting the price of properties in an area.
