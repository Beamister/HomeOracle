<h1>Third Year Project</h1>
The aim of this project is to develop a tool so that a user can predict how a house price is affected by changes in its surroundings. The underlying models should assume that the house in question remains unchanged.

For example, given a house costing Â£200,000 with the nearest school 1 mile away, then if a new school is built half a mile away then the model should predict the new price of the house.

This is being treated as a supervised learning regression problem.
